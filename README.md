# Speaker Recognition
Aalto University course ELEC-E5510 Speech Recognition

This repository contains the code for our project on Speaker Recognition in the fall 2020 Speech Recognition course. 
In this project, we tested three algorithms for a speaker identification task. The three methods are a GMM-UBM method, a RNN method and a CNN method. The three methods were trained and tested on the "clean" dataset from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus (http://www.openslr.org/12). 

For more details on the three methods and their implementation, see the PDF report. 

Here is a quick summary of the results:

| Model         | Coded by...     | Classification accuracy (%)   |
| ------------- |:---------------:| -----------------------------:|
| GMM-UBM model | A. Perez        | 71.7                          |
| RNN model     | V. Petrutiu     | 74.6                          |
| CNN model     | T.J.T. Roelofs  | 86.9                          |
